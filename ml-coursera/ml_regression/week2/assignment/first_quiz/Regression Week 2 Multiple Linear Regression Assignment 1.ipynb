The first assignment will be about exploring multiple regression in particular exploring the impact of adding features to a regression and measuring error. In the second assignment you will implement a gradient descent algorithm. In this assignment you will:\n",

Although we often think of multiple regression as including multiple different features (e.g. # of bedrooms, square feet, and # of bathrooms) but **we can also consider transformations of existing variables e.g. the log of the square feet or even \"interaction\" variables such as the product of bedrooms and bathrooms**. Add 4 new variables in both your train_data and test_data.\n",

    "Squaring bedrooms will increase the separation between not many bedrooms (e.g. 1) and lots of bedrooms (e.g. 4) since 1^2 = 1 but 4^2 = 16. Consequently this variable will mostly affect houses with many bedrooms.\n",

    "Model 1: ‘sqft_living’, ‘bedrooms’, ‘bathrooms’, ‘lat’, and ‘long’\n",
    "Model 2: ‘sqft_living’, ‘bedrooms’, ‘bathrooms’, ‘lat’,‘long’, and ‘bed_bath_rooms’\n",
